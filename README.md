------------------------------------------------------

In this repository, I will put all my projects.

++ HW1 Code Added.
    Local Alignment with Python. 
    Given two Sequences, this program finds the longest local alignment between these two genetic sequences. 
    -with a gap penalty of -5
    and using PAM250 dictionary

++ HW2 file added
    Must be a global alignment (CLUSTAL) using python
    - Not a perfect solution :(

++ HW3 file added
    Find best possible profile for a given MSA from a given sequence

++ HW4 one code added.
    HW4-regex: get a regular expression which is a protein motif and domain, then gets some sequenses and checks if they match this regex or not.
    + more than two differences means a MISMATCH
    + returns a map that says which protein is a match and which is not!
